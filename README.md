Townsmods.net Code
==============

This is a public release of the townsmods.net source code written in PHP using Laravel 3.

I, Tom K., no longer have time to manage the code, nor do I have time to run the site. Recently I was required to run an upgrade to PHP 5.5 for client work. Unfortunately this made running Townsmods rather difficult and left me with three options:

A) Update townsmods.net to Laravel 4
B) Modify Laravel 3 to remove the "Yield" statments that cause issues in PHP 5.4+
C) Close townsmods.net for good

I really didn't want to close townsmods.net and leave thousands of players without buried towns to play with, so I am releasing the source code for many others to use.


The Townsmods Docs Repository ( https://github.com/tommykent1210/townsmods/tree/master/docs ) contains limited documentation on implementing your own mods server, combined with the townsmods code itself a decent developer should be able to reverse engineer townsmods.net to create their own servers.


Thanks
Tom
